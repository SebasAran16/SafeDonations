Planning:

-Building a Smart Contract where the people will be able to donate in any or several token currencies to a certain group of donees that will be chosen by another group of admins, where any admin will be able to accept or reject the petition.

To do:

-Add a modifier that does not allow owner or admins to be able to be a donee.
